During the game you will meet 3 different bosses.
To fight with them you have to answer different question e.q. math, geography, history or just about nowadays.
1)To defeat the first boss you to answer only for 3 questions. So you have to try to hit the boss for 3 times.
	But the boss can kill in 3-4 hits
2)The second boss is a bit more difficult - you have to answer for 4 question (hit him 4 times) and he needs 3 hits to kill you.
3)Now about the last one - the most difficult. You need to answer all 10 question (hit him 10 times) to kill
